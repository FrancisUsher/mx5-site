  <h2>... and me and my MX-5</h2>

  <p>
    I purchased a 2021 MX-5 in 2024 because I needed a second car. Like many
    people I love the car but the infotainment system left me wanting. Thus
    began my journey to understand and personalize this possession, to make the
    car an extension of myself by modding it to my preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site simply documents what I have learned about my car. Nothing should
    be construed as instructions or an official manual on how the car works. It
    is better read as opinion than fact.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that vein, take anything you read here with a grain of salt. In the
    spirit of hacking, do not just copy blindly - do your own due dilligence to
    understand what you're getting into before taking action. Remember that you
    are tinkering with a toy that costs tens of thousands of dollars to replace.
    Hacking your car can potentially break it, and you may lose your toy
    permanently.
